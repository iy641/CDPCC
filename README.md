## Overview 

This repository provides the code and datasets for the proposed CDPCC model, along with baseline models, as presented in the manuscript *"Time Series Contrastive Learning via Cross-Domain Predictive and Contextual Contrasting: Application to Fault Detection"*.

We introduce Cross-Domain Predictive and Contextual Contrasting (CDPCC), a novel contrastive learning framework that integrates temporal and spectral information to capture rich time-frequency features from time series data. CDPCC consists of two key components: **i)** cross-domain predictive contrasting, which predicts future embeddings across time and frequency domains, and **ii)** cross-domain contextual contrasting, which aligns time- and frequency-based representations in a shared latent space.
